This was my first practicum project at University of New Hampshire (Summer Term). It was an opportunity for me to know about US education system and I came up with intresting visuals afer undergoing a big research by comparing US with other countries. 

There are two organizations i.e IEA (International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement) and OECD (The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) who were conducting assessments for students every three, four and five years once and helps to improve the education and build better lives in each individual.

IEA conducting TIMSS and PIRLS assessments for 4th and 8th graders and measured students mastery of subjects such as mathematics, science, and reading. There are more than 60 countries actively involved in IEA network.

OECD conducting PISA in more than 70 countries. For more than 50 years, the OECD has been a valuable source and plays an important role in sharing information, data and measuring progress on poverty eradication or inequality for the betterment of humanity and children.

In order to determine the best and worst states for public-school education, we considered few factors like Drop-out Rate, Quality, Safety, Test Scores, Pupil-Teacher Ratio, Graduation Rates, Assessment criteria. For instance we took Quality & Safety as key dimesions for ranking purpose and below is the visuals of it.
